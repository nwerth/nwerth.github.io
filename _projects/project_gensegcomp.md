Despite the increased participation of women in higher education, gendered major choice remains a persistent feature of many societies. This contribution examines individuals’ decision-making process in major choice in more detail by analyzing how gendered self-concepts create gender differences in preferences for specific field of study characteristics. More specifically, we examine the role of self-concepts in explaining gendered preferences for two interest dimensions that can be found in each major: A) Interest in tasks (such as care-related or technical tasks), and B) interest in scientific approaches (such as data-driven or ideas-driven approaches). Thereby, our analysis combines research from both sociology (on the effect of self-concepts on gendered interests for major characteristics) and psychology (on the close link between self-concepts and interests). For the empirical analyses, we use data from the second cohort of the Swiss panel study TREE and classify prospective students’ aspired majors according to these four interest dimensions. Besides individuals’ academic self-concepts, we also take into account various factors discussed in previous research (e.g., parental role models, academic performance, personality traits, behavioral preferences, etc) and decompose the gender differences in the interest dimensions using a two-fold Kitagawa-Blinder-Oaxaca approach. Our results show A) that gendered interest in scientific approaches can be largely explained in contrast gendered interests in tasks and B) that self-concepts account for most of the explained contribution regardless of the examined interest dimension.
