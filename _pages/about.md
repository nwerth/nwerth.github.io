I am a PhD candidate in Sociology with [Prof. Dr. Ben Jann](https://www.soz.unibe.ch/about_us/people/prof_dr_jann_ben/index_eng.html) at the [University of Bern](https://www.soz.unibe.ch/index_eng.html) and with [Prof. Dr. Irene Kriesi](https://www.sfuvet.swiss/person/kriesi-irene) at the [Swiss Federal University
for Vocational Education and Training](https://www.sfuvet.swiss/). Currently, I am also working as a scientific collaborator in the [TREE panel study](https://www.tree.unibe.ch/index_eng.html) at the Institute of Sociology at the University of Bern. My academic journey began with earning both my Bachelor’s degree in Social Sciences and Master’s degree in Sociology from the University of Bern. Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as a student research assistant and as a scientific collaborator in the [TREE panel study](https://www.tree.unibe.ch/index_eng.html) at the Institute of Sociology at the University of Bern.

In my research I'm interested in education, social stratification, gender inequalities, the transition from school to work and educational decision-making. In my dissertation I investigate the influence of gender stereotypes on perpetuating horizontal gender segregation in education and early-career decision-making. I aim to uncover the mechanisms through which stereotypes impact individuals' choices and contribute to broader societal disparities. Utilizing a multifaceted approach, I analyse large-scale survey data, conduct survey experiments, and analyse text data.
